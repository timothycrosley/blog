| Pitch: | isort your imports, so you don't have to. |
| Read if: | You learned how to code on an old DOS computer using QuickBasic or TurboPascel, or if you are interested in interesting coding environments.|
| Skip if: | You've already learned how to code, don't have any kids you want to teach, and aren't interested in unique coding environments. |
| Prior Work: | [QuickBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) [10 years later, QBasic is still the best](http://www.nicolasbize.com/blog/30-years-later-qbasic-is-still-the-best/) |

## One more minute please! I'm almost done!

I'm a firm believer that addictions aren't *always* bad. When you find you're self addictive to positive things, some people might even call it being driven. Either way, those of you who have read my [whoami introduction](https://timothycrosley.com/whoami)
likely know that I became addicted to programming at a very young age. Since then, I've never been able to put it down. QuickBasic was my gateway drug. Any chance I got I would spend hours making simple games, trying to automate
my homework, or building some crazy DOS UI. I didn't have access to the internet, but QuickBasics built in help, intuitive interaction with one button to start your application, and simple mechanics made it easy to pick up hard to put down.
